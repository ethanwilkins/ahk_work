Thank you for reaching out! Although there isn't a way to build class rosters through the admin account, we do recognize the need for this feature. In the meantime, students can be added to teacher rosters in one of two ways:

Through each teacher's account, they can follow these steps:
    1. Go to the Roster tab
    2. Click on "Add students" at the bottom of the class roster
    3. In the "Last name" field, begin to type in the student's last name
    4. Choose the student from the drop-down menu - this will auto-populate the rest of the student's information
    5. If the student does not show up in the drop-down menu, then the student will need an account created. Enter the student's information and click "Save." If you are unsure what the student's ID is, please check with your IXL admin.

Thank you for reaching out. I see that your subscription was purchased for XXXXXX student licenses, while there are currently XXXXX students on the master roster. We'll need to remove any additional students from the master roster in order to make room for new students who'll need access.

To remove students from the master roster, log into your admin account, go to the Students tab, and click on the red "X" to the right of the student accounts you wish to remove.

Sign into your admin account, XXXX, to access to view, add, delete, and edit any student or teacher account.

Thank you for reaching out! We do have an auto-rostering process that allows you to  upload CSVs containing student data at any time to our SFTP server, and we'll apply updates nightly at 9pm PST to keep your IXL account in sync with your Student Information System.

I have attached the file specifications for your review. If you are interested, we can move forward to the testing process. Since every file is different, the testing process may take up to two weeks.

Please let me know if you have any questions at this time.

Would you like me to move forward with this change? I look forward to hearing from you.

;----------------------------------- MERGES -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;7.01 Initial Merge Bulk/Trial to site
::x701::
(
I understand you would like to transfer the student data from your TRIAL ACCOUNT/CLASSROOM SUBSCRIPTION to the school's IXL subscription.

Since school subscriptions are set up a little differently than TRIAL ACCOUNT/CLASSROOM SUBSCRIPTION, we'll need to upload a student list to ensure that the students are set up properly. Once I upload your list, we can begin the transfer process.

To get started, please submit a complete student list with the following student information in separate columns of an Excel spreadsheet:

     - First Name
     - Last Name
     - Student ID
     - Grade
     - Teacher Name
     - Teacher E-mail

When ready, you can submit this information through the secure file upload tool by logging in to your admin account and clicking "Upload Roster Files" within the "Account Management" tab.

The last two teacher columns will allow me to add students to their class rosters.

Please note the usernames and passwords will change, but these can be edited at any time. Additionally, if students already have accounts within the school subscription, their data will be overwritten.

[ADMIN], please confirm that this merge is approved.

Let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
)

;7.02 Trial Merge Set-up Confirmation
::x702::
(
Thank you for sending this student list! I have successfully uploaded your students to the master  roster. The next step is to follow the attached instructions under the heading, "If you already have a trial account," to ensure that your trial data is successfully merged into your new license.

Again, please note that usernames and passwords will change, but these can be edited at any time. Additionally, if students already had accounts within the school subscription, their data will be overwritten.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any further assistance.
)

;7.03 Classroom Merge Confirmation
::x703::
(
I have merged [TEACHER NAME]'s classroom subscription into your school subscription. You'll notice  that usernames and passwords were updated to match the school-wide format, and all practice data has been transferred.

If the students' first and last names on the classroom roster did not match those on your master roster, their accounts were left inactive on the teacher's roster. To reactivate them, [TEACHER NAME] can log in to [HIS/HER] IXL account, go to the Students page and click "Activate" at the bottom left of the student list.

Otherwise, students are all set up and may begin practicing right away!

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any further assistance.
